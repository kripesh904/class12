        <h1 id="content_title">Chapter 1: Database Management System</h1>
        <p>A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software solution designed to efficiently manage, organize, and
            retrieve data in a structured manner. It serves as a critical component in modern computing, enabling
            organizations to store, manipulate, and secure their data effectively.</p>

        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <p>The primary objectives of a DBMS are to provide a convenient and efficient way to store, retrieve, and manage
            data while ensuring data integrity, security, and consistency. It aims to reduce data redundancy, enable
            concurrent access, and support backup and recovery mechanisms.</p>

        <h2>Advantages</h2>
        <p>Some advantages of DBMS include:
        <ul>
            <li>Improved data sharing and accessibility</li>
            <li>Data security and privacy control</li>
            <li>Reduced data redundancy and inconsistency</li>
            <li>Efficient data management and backup</li>
            <li>Support for concurrent multi-user environments</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        </p>

        <h3>Data</h3>
        <p>Data refers to raw facts and figures without context. It can be numbers, text, images, or any other form of
            input that can be processed or stored.</p>

        <h3>Information</h3>
        <p>Information is processed data that is meaningful and useful for decision-making. It is data interpreted in a
            context to provide value.</p>

        <h3>Features of Information</h3>
        <p>Key features of information include:
        <ul>
            <li>Accuracy</li>
            <li>Relevance</li>
            <li>Timeliness</li>
            <li>Completeness</li>
            <li>Understandability</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Database and Its Purpose</h3>
        <p>A database is a structured collection of related data stored electronically. Its purpose is to organize data
            efficiently to enable easy retrieval, manipulation, and management for various applications.</p>

        <h2>Terminologies in Database</h2>

        <h3>Table</h3>
        <p>A table is a collection of rows and columns that stores data in a structured format within a database.</p>

        <h3>Field</h3>
        <p>A field (or column) represents a single attribute or category of data in a table.</p>

        <h3>Record</h3>
        <p>A record (or row) is a single, complete set of related fields in a table, representing one entity or
            instance.</p>

        <h3>Tuple</h3>
        <p>A tuple is another term for a record in a relational database, representing a single data item.</p>

        <h3>Object</h3>
        <p>An object is a data structure encapsulating both data and behavior, commonly used in object-oriented
            databases.</p>

        <h3>Keys</h3>
        <p>Keys are attributes that uniquely identify records in a table, such as primary keys and foreign keys.</p>

        <h3>Data Dictionary</h3>
        <p>A data dictionary is a repository that stores metadata about the database objects, such as definitions,
            relationships, and constraints.</p>

        <h2>Types of Database Model</h2>
        <p>Database models define the logical structure of databases, specifying how data is stored, organized, and
            manipulated.</p>

        <h3>Hierarchical</h3>
        <p>The hierarchical model organizes data in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, suitable for
            one-to-many relationships.</p>

        <h3>Network</h3>
        <p>The network model allows more complex relationships with a graph structure, supporting many-to-many
            connections between records.</p>

        <h3>Relational</h3>
        <p>The relational model stores data in tables with rows and columns, emphasizing data independence and
            supporting SQL for queries.</p>

        <h3>Entity-Relationship</h3>
        <p>The Entity-Relationship (ER) model is a conceptual design tool used to represent data entities, their
            attributes, and relationships visually before implementation.</p>

        <h2>Integrity Constraints and Types</h2>
        <p>Integrity constraints ensure accuracy and consistency of data within the database by enforcing rules.</p>

        <h3>Domain</h3>
        <p>Domain constraints specify the permissible values for a given attribute, such as data type or range
            restrictions.</p>

        <h3>Entity</h3>
        <p>Entity integrity ensures that each table has a primary key and that key values are unique and not null.</p>

        <h3>Referential</h3>
        <p>Referential integrity ensures that foreign keys in a table correctly reference primary keys in another table,
            maintaining relationships between tables.</p>

        <h3>Keys</h3>
        <p>Key constraints enforce uniqueness and identification of records, including primary keys, candidate keys, and
            foreign keys.</p>


        <h2>Normalization</h2>
        <p>Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data
            integrity. It involves dividing large tables into smaller, related tables and defining relationships among
            them.</p>
        <h3>Normal Forms</h3>
        <p>Normal forms are guidelines used to ensure that databases are logically organized. The most commonly used
            normal forms are 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF.</p>
        <h3>1NF, 2NF, 3NF</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1NF (First Normal Form): A table is in 1NF if all its attributes have atomic (indivisible)
                values.</li>
            <li>2NF (Second Normal Form): A table is in 2NF if it is in 1NF and all non-key
                attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.</li>
            <li>3NF (Third Normal
                Form): A table is in 3NF if it is in 2NF and all its attributes are only dependent on the
                primary key.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Advantages</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduces data redundancy</li>
            <li>Improves data consistency</li>
